        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagne is a popular dish, especially among children and young people.</p>
        <p>It doesn't take much time to prepare, as the final cooking stage takes place in the oven without our assistance. The result is well worth it. This delicious dish is also a good choice for Sunday lunch.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients (4 servings)</h2>
        <h3>Meat mix</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 packet of lasagna</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>400 g minced beef</li>
            <li>cooking oil</li>
            <li>oregano</li>
            <li>basil</li>
            <li>barbecue seasoning</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>tomato paste/ketchup</li>
            <li>minced pepper</li>
            <li>1 can of peeled tomatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Béchamel</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>50 g of butter</li>
            <li>50 g finely ground flour</li>
            <li>500 ml of milk</li>
            <li>a pinch of nutmeg</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>minced pepper</li>
            <li>hard cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the meat mixture: fry finely chopped onion and sliced garlic in oil until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Then add the minced meat and, stirring constantly and separating the pieces from each other, let it brown. Season the meat with salt and spices, add ketchup.</li>
            <li>Season generously to achieve a distinctive flavour. Fry until the meat is cooked. Then add the tinned tomatoes, simmer briefly and season to taste.</li>
            <li>For the béchamel sauce, melt the butter, add the plain flour and make a roux.</li>
            <li>When the roux is fried, add milk, nutmeg, salt and ground pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened (consistency similar to pudding).</li>
            <li>Line a baking dish with baking paper. Finely grate the hard cheese.</li>
            <li>Start layering the lasagne in a baking dish. Place a layer of lasagne sheets, then add some of the meat mixture and a layer of béchamel sauce, then another layer of pasta sheets and repeat the process until all the ingredients are used up.</li>
            <li>The last layer should be meat and béchamel sauce, which we sprinkle with grated cheese. Bake at 180 °C for about 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
